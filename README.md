## Installation

### 1. Download Python:

```
Make sure you have Python installed and it is added to your path.
```
### 1. Download The Files:

```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
### 2. Open The build.bat File:

```
You dont need to install any modules opening this will install them for you. Then you can open the build.bat which will
open a terminal with the kyoku logo. Don't worry although this looks quite menacing its just aesthetic and is normal.
```
### 3. Create A Webhook:

```
This webhook will be sent any victims you log so don't delete it once it's made. Once you've created one paste it
into the terminal when prompted.
```
### 4. Configurable Options:

```
Now once you've given your file a name you can pick between some options by typing either y or n for each one. After
having done that the file will be built and ready for usage.
```
### 5. Test The File:

```
You will then be promtped as to whether you want to run the file or not. I recommend this so you
can see if there are any issues or not.
```
### 6. What Now?

```
The .exe file will appear in the same folder where all the other files are with the name you set it as and you can now send
this to your victims.😈
```
